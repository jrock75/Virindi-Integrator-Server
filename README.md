### Information
A slapped together emulator for Virindi Integrator 2.

This code was my attempt at creating an emulator for Virindi Integrator 2.  
Various people have asked me for the source code since hosting ceased, so here it is.

When I wrote this code I never planned for it to be public, this has lead to some sections being pretty shit and slapped together with no thought or consideration, keep this in mind while looking at the code.
